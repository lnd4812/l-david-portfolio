# l-david-portfolio

The purpose of this project is establish a portfolio using the CSS formatting guidlines introduced in Module 2 to produce a responsive webpage that can be viewed on multiple platforms, devices and/or screen sizes without losing the integrity of site display.  This project will also form the basis of the portfolio which I, as a student in this Bootcamp course, will build upon through the various challenges and beyond as one of the necessary resources required to demonstrate my abilities to prospective employers and clients.

## Design

The main design of this page is fairly basic - a header, hero, main section and footer.  Each section was set up as a container with flex display characteristics, enabling the contents inside them to expand or contract based on the size of the viewing platform.  Additional flex characteristics, including nested flexboxes, were applied to the child elements within each main container.  

Images were fitted into their respective div containers via background url designations, as I was having difficulty getting them to fit properly when following feedback obtained during Mar05/22 office hours (the TA was having difficulty hearing me and was not able to fully address my) and various sites on the internet.  This formatting, appears to enable the images and tags on which are indicated the project name and link for each to respond in the manner specified in the Acceptance Criteria.

I recognize I have not met a few Acceptance Criteria, the main one being the responsive display, and had to change my draft resume to an image file in order to complete the link. I believe the other criteria requirements appear to be in order.  I do, however, recognize that the responsive display is the most crucial of the Acceptance Criteria for this project and I also recognize that further study, research and practice are obviously required in order for me to improve the design and formatting to a more acceptable standard.
