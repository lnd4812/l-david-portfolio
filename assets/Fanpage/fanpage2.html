        <h2>Who is Depeche Mode?</h2>
                        
            <p>Depeche Mode is a British trio that first burst onto the music scene in the 70's and which is still in business almost 50 years later.</p>
            
       <h2>Members of the Band</h2>

            <p>For most of their 40+ year history, there have been 3 main members:</p>
                <div class="members">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Martin Gore</li>
                        <li>Andy Fletcher</li>
                        <li>Dave Gahan</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
            
            <p>Dave Gahan became part of the group early on and it remained a foursome until 1981, when Vince Clarke departed the band, teaming up not long after with Alison Moyet to form Yaz.</p>
            <p>It became a foursome again when Dave and the two remaining original members, Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher were joined by Alan Wilder in 1982.</p>
            <p>Upon the departure of Alan 13 years later in 1995, Depeche Mode was once again a trio and have remained so to this day.</p>

            <p>The number of songs and compilations they've released is too vast to list here.</p>
            <p>A few that I happened to like were:</p>
